# Python Cluster Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Python project focused on cluster analysis using the famous Iris dataset.

## Overview

The project aims to explore and apply various clustering algorithms to the Iris dataset, a popular benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It leverages Python libraries such as scikit-learn to perform clustering techniques and gain insights into the underlying patterns and structures within the data.

## Contents

- `data`: This folder contains the Iris dataset used for clustering analysis.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the implementation of different clustering algorithms, data preprocessing steps, and evaluation techniques.
- `scripts`: Python scripts that provide utility functions and helper classes for the clustering process.
- `results`: This folder stores the evaluation metrics, visualizations, and cluster assignments.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have the required dependencies installed. The notebooks provide step-by-step instructions to preprocess the data, apply clustering algorithms, and evaluate the results. You can experiment with different algorithms and parameter settings to gain a deeper understanding of the Iris dataset.
